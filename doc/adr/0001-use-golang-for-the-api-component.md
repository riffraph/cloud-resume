## Status

Accepted

## Context

A technology needs to be chosen for the API layer.

Many to choose from, e.g. python, jvm based or nodejs

Use Golang for the API component, as it has good support on GCP and I want to practice this.

## Consequences

The need to experience the ups and downs of learning a language to a level where you can deploy and run code in production.
